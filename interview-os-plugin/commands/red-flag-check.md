# Red Flag Check Command

Run this when something in the interview process feels off.

## Usage

```
/red-flag-check "[Describe what happened]"
```

Examples:
- `/red-flag-check "Interviewer was 20 minutes late and didn't apologize"`
- `/red-flag-check "They said 'we're like a family here'"`
- `/red-flag-check "They've rescheduled my interview 3 times"`

## What This Does

Immediately invokes **redflag-navigator** skill to:

1. **Categorize the Flag**
   - Organizational Chaos
   - Culture Toxicity
   - Respect Issues
   - Process Problems

2. **Assess Severity**
   - 🟢 GREEN: Probably fine
   - 🟡 YELLOW: Worth noting
   - 🟠 ORANGE: Concerning
   - 🔴 RED: Strong exit signal

3. **Decode the Concern**
   - What they said/did (surface)
   - What it really means (hidden motivation)
   - What it signals about working there

4. **Provide Response Strategy**
   - In-the-moment power move response
   - Follow-up actions to take
   - Validation research to run

5. **Decision Guidance**
   - Should you proceed?

## Response Examples

### Example 1: "We're like a family"

```
Assessment: 🟠 ORANGE - Culture Toxicity

Concern: Boundary issues, unpaid overtime expectations

Power Move: "That's great to hear about team closeness. Can you tell me more about how the team balances collaboration with work-life boundaries? How do team members typically handle time off?"

Follow-Up: Research Glassdoor/Reddit for work-life balance complaints

Decision: CAUTION - Proceed only if they give concrete WLB examples
```

### Example 2: Multiple Reschedules

```
Assessment: 🔴 RED - Organizational Chaos (3+ reschedules)

Concern: Disorganization, you're not a priority, likely chaotic work environment

Power Move Email: "I appreciate the interest, but I'm going to move forward with other opportunities that align better with my timeline."

Decision: WALK AWAY - This pattern rarely improves after hire
```

## When to Use This Command

✅ **Use it when**:
- Something feels off
- Interviewer said something weird
- Process seems disorganized
- You're questioning whether to continue

❌ **Don't use it for**:
- Normal interview nerves (that's just anxiety!)
- Standard tough questions
- Feeling unprepared (use practice-mode instead)

## Trust Your Gut

If your instinct is saying "something's wrong," there's usually a reason.

This command helps you:
- Validate your concerns with data
- Distinguish real flags from nerves
- Make empowered decisions
- Walk away with confidence when needed

**The right opportunity will respect you from day one.**

## Output

You'll receive:
- Red flag severity assessment
- Specific category and concerns
- Power-move response to use
- Validation research suggestions
- Clear decision recommendation

## Remember

**You're interviewing them too.** Red flags are data points helping you avoid toxic environments.

It's better to walk away from a bad fit than to spend years recovering from a toxic job.
