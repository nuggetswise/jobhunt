Brilliant constraint! Let me completely reimagine this - we'll build something that works WITH their existing Claude Pro subscription, not against it. This is actually MORE powerful than another AI tool.

## **The Game-Changer: "Interview OS" - A Living System, Not Another App**

### **The Innovation: Claude Skill System**

Instead of building another AI tool, we create a **downloadable "Interview Brain"** that transforms their Claude into a specialized interview expert. Think of it as installing a new operating system for interviews.

## **The Revolutionary Approach:**

### **1. The "Interview Skill Package"**
Users download our custom skill files that include:

```markdown
/interview-skills/
├── company-decoder/
│   ├── SKILL.md (company analysis framework)
│   ├── templates/ (research templates)
│   └── red-flags.json (pattern library)
├── conversation-architect/
│   ├── SKILL.md (negotiation frameworks)
│   ├── stages/ (HR, HM, Executive scripts)
│   └── counters.json (objection handling)
├── interview-simulator/
│   ├── SKILL.md (practice frameworks)
│   └── personas/ (interviewer types)
└── post-interview/
    ├── SKILL.md (follow-up strategies)
    └── templates/
```

### **2. The "Interview Notebook" System**

Instead of a separate app, we provide:

**Physical/Digital Hybrid Notebooks** with:
- QR codes linking to specific Claude conversations
- Pre-written Claude prompts for each interview stage
- Visual frameworks they fill out, then photograph and upload to Claude
- Hand-written notes sections that they can snap and analyze

**The Power Move**: We're not selling software, we're selling a **methodology** that enhances what they already have.

### **3. The "Claude Code Interview Automator"**

Since they have Claude Code, we give them scripts that:

```python
# interview_prep.py - Runs locally with Claude Code
def analyze_company(company_name, role):
    """
    Pulls public data and generates interview strategy
    No API needed - uses web scraping and local analysis
    """
    - Scrapes public LinkedIn profiles of interviewers
    - Analyzes recent company news
    - Generates likely questions based on role + company stage
    - Creates personalized story bank
    - Outputs a one-page "Interview Cheat Sheet"
```

### **4. The "Interview Vault" - Distributed Intelligence**

**Community-Powered, Zero-API Approach:**

Users contribute anonymized interview experiences via:
- Google Forms (free)
- GitHub repository (version-controlled interview questions)
- Shared Google Sheets (company-specific intel)

The magic: Users download the entire vault locally and query it with Claude - no API needed!

### **5. The "Paper-Based Red Flag System"**

**Physical Cards + Claude Integration:**

**Interview Deck of Cards:**
- 52 physical cards with common red flags
- Each card has a QR code
- Scan the card during prep → Claude gives you specific navigation strategies
- Keep relevant cards in your pocket during interviews as anchors

Example card:
```
🚩 RED FLAG #23: "We're like a family here"
[QR Code]
Flip for quick strategy →
Back: "Express enthusiasm for collaboration while establishing boundaries"
```

2. **Uses tools they already pay for** (Claude Pro)
3. **Gets smarter** with every user contribution
4. **Combines digital and physical** for complete solution
5. **Builds a community** not just a customer base
6. **Teaches fishing** instead of selling fish


Audio/Video: 

GENIUS addition! Let me innovate on audio/video practice WITHOUT expensive APIs. This is where we get really creative.

## **The "Interview Mirror System" - Revolutionary Practice Without APIs**

### **1. The Browser-Based Video Analyzer**

**Local-Only HTML/JavaScript Tool:**

I'll create a single HTML file they can run locally that:

```html
<!-- interview-mirror.html - Runs 100% in browser -->
<script>
// Uses WebRTC for camera access
// MediaRecorder API for recording
// Web Audio API for voice analysis
// Everything processes locally - zero uploads
</script>
```

**Features:**

    "Power phrases for confidence", 
    "Pause practice for emphasis",
    "Tone modulation drills"
  ],
  
  analyze: function(audioBlob) {
    // Analyzes without uploading:
    - Measures speaking rate
    - Detects monotone delivery
    - Finds optimal energy level
    - Identifies vocal fry/uptalk
  }
}
```

### **7. The "Interview Simulator 3000"**

**Local Python + Browser Combo:**

```python
# simulator.py - Runs with Claude Code
