# INTERVIEW OS - PRODUCT SPECIFICATION
## CPO Review Document

**Date:** 2025-11-04
**Prepared By:** Product Management Team
**Status:** Draft for CPO Approval
**Version:** 1.0

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Product:** Interview OS - An AI-powered interview preparation system that transforms Claude into a specialized interview coach

**Core Insight:** Job seekers already pay $20/month for Claude Pro but use it generically. We turn their existing subscription into a specialized interview expert through downloadable skill files.

**Mission-Driven Philosophy:**
This is NOT a profit-maximization venture. Success = break-even while helping candidates reach final rounds. We're building a community service that pays for itself, not extracting maximum revenue from desperate job seekers.

**North Star Metric:** % of Users Reaching Final Rounds
- NOT revenue, NOT downloads, NOT engagement vanity metrics
- We succeed when users get to final interview stages
- Everything optimizes for this outcome

**Market Opportunity:**
- 150M+ job interviews conducted annually in US alone
- $1.2B+ interview prep market (courses, coaching, tools)
- Growing AI adoption in job search (82% of job seekers use AI - 2024 data)

**Our Approach:** Pure digital skill-based architecture. Users download 5 Claude skill files that unlock systematic interview preparation workflows.

**Business Model:** One-time purchase ($49 accessible pricing). Zero recurring costs, zero API fees, zero upsells. Pay once, own forever.

## SECTION 1: COMPETITIVE MOAT ANALYSIS

### Philosophy as Moat: Why We Don't Care About 2-4 Week Copies

**Mission-Driven Perspective:**
"We don't care what competitors can do in 2-4 weeks if we're genuinely serving the community."

**Why Traditional Defensive Moats Don't Matter:**

✓ **Not Technology** - Skills are markdown files with prompts (easily copied) → We don't care, let them copy
✓ **Not Data** - We use public web search, no proprietary dataset → Accessibility is the point
✓ **Not Platform Lock-in** - Users own the files, can use anywhere → User ownership is a feature
✓ **Not IP/Patents** - Prompts and frameworks are not patentable → Knowledge should be free

**Our Real Moat:** Deep value creation that can't be rushed

---

### 💪 Our ACTUAL Moat (4 Philosophy Layers from moatleadpm.md)

#### Layer 1: 4-Layer Strategic Depth (From moatleadpm.md)

**What It Is:**
Not just "answer questions" but a complete strategic framework:

- **Layer 1 (Tactical):** Answer common questions, STAR format, basic research
- **Layer 2 (Operational):** Decode interviewer psychology, adapt energy, navigate power dynamics
- **Layer 3 (Strategic):** Position as solution to unspoken problems, build internal champions, create leverage
- **Layer 4 (Meta-Strategic):** Recognize when to walk away, understand market value trajectory, build career-long skills

**Why It's Defensible:**
- Competitors think at Layer 1-2, we operate at Layer 3-4
- This isn't prompt engineering, it's encoded expertise from years of recruiting wisdom
- Can't be copied without understanding the deep psychology and dynamics
- Users experience transformation, not just preparation

---

#### Layer 2: Compound Intelligence System

**What It Is:**
- 5 skills that work as an **orchestrated system**, not isolated tools
- Intelligence multiplies: company-intel → story-builder → interview-decoder → practice-analyzer → redflag-navigator
- Each skill makes others smarter through data flow
- System gets better with every use (personal network effects)

**Why It's Defensible:**
- Competitors build isolated tools, we build intelligence that compounds
- Integration requires understanding entire interview ecosystem
- User's system becomes personalized intelligence engine over time
- Pattern recognition emerges from system usage

---

#### Layer 3: Expertise Encoding (From moatleadpm.md)

**What It Is:**
20+ years of recruiting/hiring wisdom embedded in prompts:
- Recruiter psychology (why they ghost, what metrics drive them)
- Hiring manager dynamics (budget battles, team politics, pressure points)
- Executive perspectives (strategic vs tactical thinking, risk tolerance)
- Power dynamics (leverage creation, champion building, negotiation psychology)

**Why It's Defensible:**
- This knowledge can't be Googled or scraped
- It's pattern recognition from thousands of real interviews
- Competitors can copy words, not the insight behind them
- Depth of expertise takes years to accumulate

---

#### Layer 4: Philosophy-Driven Approach (Mission Moat)

**What It Is:**
We're not teaching interview tricks. We're building:
- Career strategists, not interview performers
- Power negotiators, not passive candidates
- Company evaluators, not desperate job seekers
- Value creators, not resume decorators

**Why It's Defensible:**
- This mindset shift is impossible to copy because it requires rethinking the entire interview process
- Mission-driven (break-even = success) means we optimize for user outcomes, not revenue extraction
- $49 accessible pricing vs $99-299 competitors signals different values
- Competitors who try to copy miss the philosophy and create shallow imitations
- Users trust mission-driven products more than profit-maximizing ones

---

### 🎯 Moat Strategy: Deep Value First, Community Later

**Philosophy-First Approach:**
We're not racing to build defensive moats. We're creating such deep value that users naturally gravitate to us.

**Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2): MVP Launch - Individual Value**
- 5 core skills delivering immediate transformation
- Focus: Help users reach final rounds
- No community features yet
- Goal: Prove individual value proposition works

**Phase 2 (Months 1-3): Refinement Through Real Use**
- Iterate based on actual user outcomes
- Track: % reaching final rounds (North Star)
- Deepen expertise encoding in prompts
- Goal: Best-in-class individual preparation system

**Phase 3 (Months 3-6+): Community If/When Needed**
- Only add community features if individual value plateaus
- Community vault is enhancement, not requirement
- Users should get full value without community
- Goal: Sustainable mission-driven product

**The Non-Race:** We don't care about beating competitors to market. We care about helping users reach final rounds.

## SECTION 2: COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE

### Direct Competitors

| Competitor | Strengths | Weaknesses | Our Advantage |
|------------|-----------|------------|---------------|
| **Interviewing.io** | Real human practice, realistic feedback | $100-300 per session, limited availability | 100x cheaper, unlimited practice |
| **Pramp** | Free peer practice, community | Generic feedback, luck-based matching | Systematic frameworks, AI-powered insights |
| **Big Interview** | Video lessons, structured curriculum | Generic advice, no personalization | Company-specific intelligence, real-time adaptation |
| **Final Round AI** | AI mock interviews, speech analysis | $80-149/month subscription fatigue | Zero recurring cost, privacy-first |
| **Exponent** | PM/Tech specific content, great courses | $40/month ongoing, passive learning | Active practice, one-time cost |

### Indirect Competitors

| Competitor | Threat Level | Why They Could Win | Why We Could Win |
|------------|--------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **ChatGPT Plus** | HIGH | Users already have it, default choice | Our prompts are 10x better for interviews |
| **Claude Pro (raw)** | HIGH | We build on their platform | Skill system is transformative upgrade |
| **Glassdoor** | MEDIUM | Trusted brand, company data | We synthesize + add strategy layer |
| **Blind** | LOW | Real company insights | Limited interview prep features |
| **YouTube** | LOW | Free, abundant content | Passive vs active, no personalization |

### The Real Competition: INERTIA

**Our biggest competitor isn't another product - it's users doing nothing.**

Most job seekers:
1. Google "common interview questions"
2. Practice answers in their head (not out loud)
3. Wing it on the day
4. Accept first offer without negotiating

**Product Implication:** We must make Interview OS **stupidly easy to start using**. Friction is our enemy.

### Success Metrics (North Star)

**North Star Metric:** % of Users Reaching Final Rounds

**Why This Metric:**
- Directly measures what we care about: helping users succeed in interviews
- NOT revenue (we're mission-driven, not profit-driven)
- NOT downloads or engagement vanity metrics
- Aligns with mission: break-even while maximizing user outcomes
- Forces us to optimize for actual interview success

**How We Track It:**
- Simple post-interview survey: "Did you reach final round? (Yes/No/Still in process)"
- Definition: Final round = last interview stage before offer/rejection
- Track conversion rate: % of users who reach final rounds vs those who don't

**Supporting Metrics:**

| Category | Metric | Target (Month 1) | Target (Month 3) | Why It Matters |
|----------|--------|------------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Primary Outcome** | % reaching final rounds | 40% | 60% | North Star - our mission |
| **Activation** | % who use ≥3 skills | 50% | 70% | System value vs single skill |
| **User Success** | % who receive offers | 30% | 45% | Ultimate outcome |
| **Skill Efficacy** | Avg skills used per user | 3 | 4 | Engagement depth |
| **Value Signal** | NPS from users in final rounds | 50 | 70 | Product-market fit |
| **Sustainability** | Revenue vs costs | Break-even path visible | Break-even achieved | Mission: sustainable, not profitable |

## SECTION 4: PRODUCT DIFFERENTIATION

### What Makes Us Different (User-Facing)

#### 1. **Systematic, Not Scattered**
- ❌ Competitors: Isolated tools (just practice OR just company research)
- ✅ Us: End-to-end workflow (research → prep → practice → negotiate → reflect)

#### 2. **Active, Not Passive**
- ❌ Competitors: Watch videos, read articles (passive learning)
- ✅ Us: Practice out loud, get feedback, iterate (active learning)

#### 3. **Personalized, Not Generic**
- ❌ Competitors: "Here are common interview questions"
- ✅ Us: "Here are Stripe's specific questions based on 47 user experiences"

#### 4. **Augmented, Not Replacement**
- ❌ Competitors: "Use our AI instead of Claude"
- ✅ Us: "Make your Claude Pro subscription 10x more valuable"

#### 5. **Privacy-First, Not Data Extraction**
- ❌ Competitors: Upload videos to their servers, analyze with their models
- ✅ Us: Everything runs locally, your data stays on your device

#### 6. **One-Time, Not Subscription Fatigue**
- ❌ Competitors: $40-149/month recurring (Netflix fatigue is real)
- ✅ Us: Pay once, own forever, zero recurring costs

---

### What Makes Us Different (Technical)

#### 1. **Skill-Based Architecture**
- Modular system (use what you need, when you need it)
- Each skill is standalone but integrates with others
- Future-proof (easy to add new skills without breaking existing)

#### 2. **Local-First Processing**
- Zero uploads to external servers
- Browser-based tools (WebRTC, Web Audio API)
- Privacy-preserving by design

#### 3. **Zero API Dependencies**
- No backend to maintain
- No API rate limits
- No recurring infrastructure costs
- Product never "shuts down" due to API costs

#### 4. **Leverages Existing Subscriptions**
- Users already pay $20/month for Claude Pro
- We unlock value they're already paying for
- No additional recurring cost

#### 5. **Community-Powered Data**
- Distributed intelligence (not centralized database)
- Users contribute anonymously
- Data compounds over time (network effects)

---

### Technical Risks & Mitigation

#### Risk 1: Claude Skill System Changes
**Probability:** MEDIUM
**Impact:** HIGH
**Description:** Anthropic changes .claude/skills/ architecture or deprecates feature

**Mitigation:**
- Skills are plain markdown (easily adaptable to other formats)
- No proprietary APIs or features used
- Maintain version compatibility matrix
- Build export feature to other AI tools (ChatGPT, etc.)

---

#### Risk 2: Web Search Rate Limiting
**Probability:** MEDIUM
**Impact:** MEDIUM
**Description:** Claude restricts web search frequency, breaks company-intel skill

**Mitigation:**
- Add manual data entry fallbacks
- Cache common company searches
- Provide static research templates
- Partner with data providers (backup API)

---

#### Risk 3: Browser API Compatibility
**Probability:** LOW
**Impact:** MEDIUM
**Description:** WebRTC/Web Audio not supported in some browsers

**Mitigation:**
- Progressive enhancement (core features work without browser tools)
- Feature detection + graceful degradation
- Support guide for enabling browser permissions
- Mobile-friendly alternatives (record on phone, upload transcript)

---

#### Risk 4: Community Vault Adoption
**Probability:** HIGH
**Impact:** HIGH
**Description:** Users don't contribute to vault, no network effects

**Mitigation:**
- Seed vault with initial data (100+ companies, 1,000+ questions)
- Gamification (leaderboard, badges, reputation)
- Make contribution stupidly easy (one-click upload)
- Show users immediate value ("You've unlocked 47 new Stripe questions")

---

## SECTION 6: GO-TO-MARKET CONSIDERATIONS
*(Per request, keeping brief - not core focus)*

**Distribution Channels:**
- Product Hunt launch (credibility + initial users)
- Reddit (r/cscareerquestions, r/experienceddevs)
- LinkedIn organic content (interview tips → product)
- Discord/Slack communities (bootcamps, CS students)

**Pricing Strategy:**
- $49 flat pricing (accessible, mission-driven)
- NO premium tiers, NO upsells, NO single-skill unbundling
- Pay once, own forever
- Price reflects mission: sustainable, not profit-maximizing

**Word-of-Mouth Strategy:**
- After user lands job: "Would you recommend Interview OS to a friend?"
- Referral incentive: Vault contribution credits
- Success stories: "I negotiated $30k more using Interview OS"

---

## SECTION 7: PRODUCT ROADMAP

### Phase 1: MVP (Weeks 1-2) - "Launch Fast, Validate Mission"
**Goal:** Get 5 core skills in users' hands, test if we help them reach final rounds

**What's Already Done (Reuse from Morespecs.md):**
- ✅ interview-decoder.md (already written)
- ✅ practice-analyzer.md (already written)
- ✅ redflag-navigator.md (already written)

**What Needs Building (NEW):**
- ⏳ story-builder.md (build from scratch)
- ⏳ company-intel.md (build from scratch)
- ⏳ .claude/claude.md (orchestration for 5 skills)
- ⏳ Installation guide (simple, 5-minute setup)
- ⏳ Quick-start workflow guide

**Development Estimate:**
- story-builder.md: 8 hours (IMPACT-R framework, web search integration)
- company-intel.md: 12 hours (systematic research protocol, One-Page Brief generation)
- claude.md: 4 hours (skill orchestration, usage patterns)
- Installation + guides: 4 hours (documentation)
- **Total: 28 hours (~2 weeks at focused pace)**

**Success Criteria:**
- 20 early users (friends, network)
- 50%+ reach final rounds (proves concept)
- NPS ≥ 50 from those who reach final rounds

---

### Phase 2: Refinement (Weeks 3-8) - "Iterate on Outcomes"
**Goal:** Improve based on real user feedback, focus on North Star metric

**Focus Areas:**
- Refine prompts based on what helps users reach final rounds
- Add examples/templates that users request
- Improve skill integration if friction points emerge
- Track and optimize North Star metric

**NOT building unless users demand it:**
- Browser-based tools (interview-mirror.html)
- Email templates (skills can generate)
- Advanced features

**Success Criteria:**
- 100 total users
- 60%+ reach final rounds
- Clear pattern: which skills correlate with success

---

### Phase 3: Scale or Pivot (Months 3-6) - "Mission Validation"
**Goal:** Determine if mission-driven approach is working

**If North Star is strong (60%+ reaching final rounds):**
- Continue current approach
- Reach break-even through word-of-mouth
- Consider community features

**If North Star is weak (<40% reaching final rounds):**
- Deep analysis: What's blocking success?
- Pivot skills or approach
- Don't scale what doesn't work

**Success Criteria:**
- Break-even (revenue = costs)
- Sustained 60%+ final round rate
- Organic growth without paid marketing

---

### Phase 4: Community (Only If Needed, Months 6+)
**Goal:** Add community features only if individual value plateaus

**Potential Features (NOT committed):**
- Community vault of interview questions
- Company-specific intelligence sharing
- User-contributed red flag database

**Only build if:**
- Individual skills hitting limitations
- Users explicitly requesting community features
- North Star metric would improve with community data

---

## SECTION 8: RISKS & OPEN QUESTIONS

### Product Risks

#### 1. **Value Perception Risk**
**Risk:** Users don't see $99 value in markdown files
**Likelihood:** MEDIUM
**Impact:** HIGH (blocks adoption)

**Mitigation:**
- Free tier (1 skill free, try before buy)
- Demo video showing real usage
- Money-back guarantee (30 days)
- Social proof (testimonials, success stories)

---

#### 2. **Complexity Risk**
**Risk:** Users find 7 skills overwhelming, don't know where to start
**Likelihood:** HIGH
**Impact:** MEDIUM (reduces activation)

**Mitigation:**
- Onboarding wizard (asks context, suggests starting point)
- Quick start guides (3-day prep, 1-week prep, negotiation-only)
- Simplified "lite" version (3 essential skills only)
- Video walkthroughs for each skill

---

#### 3. **Quality Control Risk**
**Risk:** Community vault fills with low-quality contributions
**Likelihood:** MEDIUM
**Impact:** MEDIUM (degrades product value)

**Mitigation:**
- Upvote/downvote system (Reddit-style)
- Moderation queue (flag suspicious contributions)
- Reputation system (trusted contributors)
- AI filtering (detect spam, duplicates)

---

### Market Risks

#### 4. **AI Commoditization Risk**
**Risk:** ChatGPT/Claude get so good that specialized prompts don't matter
**Likelihood:** MEDIUM (18-24 months)
**Impact:** HIGH (erodes entire product)

**Mitigation:**
- Shift focus to community data (AI can't replicate vault)
- Build workflow automation (orchestration is valuable even with better AI)
- Develop human services (mock interviews, coaching)
- Create content moat (courses, frameworks, methodology)

---

#### 5. **Platform Risk**
**Risk:** Anthropic builds interview prep directly into Claude
**Likelihood:** LOW (not their core business)
**Impact:** HIGH (direct competition)

**Mitigation:**
- Build on multiple platforms (ChatGPT, Gemini versions)
- Own user relationship (email list, community)
- Differentiate on data (community vault)
- Partner with Anthropic (official skills marketplace)

---

### Open Questions for CPO

#### Question 1: Single-Skill Purchases?
Should we allow users to buy individual skills ($29 each) or only full bundle ($99)?

**Pros (Unbundled):**
- Lower friction for negotiation-only users (large segment)
- More total customers (even if lower LTV)
- Word-of-mouth from casual users

**Cons (Unbundled):**
- Reduces revenue per user (6x $29 = $174 potential vs $99 actual)
- Users miss holistic value
- More support complexity

**Recommendation:** Bundle only at launch, add unbundling after Month 3 based on user feedback.

---

#### Question 2: Freemium Model?
Should we offer a free tier (1-2 skills free, pay to unlock all)?

**Pros:**
- Lowers adoption friction
- Try-before-buy increases conversion
- Viral loop (free users refer paying users)

**Cons:**
- Revenue risk (most stay on free tier)
- Support costs for free users
- Devalues product ("if it's free, it's not valuable")

**Recommendation:** No freemium at launch. If growth stalls after Month 2, test free tier (company-intel only).

---

#### Question 3: Community Vault Access?
Should vault access be:
- *Option A:* Included with purchase (pay-once, access forever)
- *Option B:* Separate subscription ($9/month)
- *Option C:* Contribution-based (contribute 5 interviews, unlock 50)

**Recommendation:** Option A at launch (builds goodwill), test Option C after Month 6 (sustainable long-term).

---

#### Question 4: B2B Play?
Should we pursue enterprise sales (universities, bootcamps, outplacement firms)?

**Pros:**
- Higher ACV ($5k-50k vs $99)
- Faster revenue growth
- Stable revenue stream

**Cons:**
- Long sales cycles (6+ months)
- Requires dedicated B2B team
- Distracts from product development

**Recommendation:** Focus on B2C for first 6 months. Pilot B2B in Month 7 with 2-3 bootcamps.

---

#### Question 5: Practice-Analyzer Approach?
Should we build interview-mirror.html (browser tool) or accept manual analysis?

**Context:** Video analysis is 40% specified, requires 40 hours dev work.

**Option A:** Build browser tool (user records, tool analyzes)
**Option B:** Manual analysis (user self-assesses, Claude guides)
**Option C:** Partner integration (integrate with Loom, record there)

**Recommendation:** Option A (build browser tool). Practice-analyzer is core value prop; manual analysis feels incomplete.

---

## SECTION 9: RECOMMENDATION & APPROVAL REQUEST

### Product Readiness Assessment

| Criteria | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **Market Need** | ✅ VALIDATED | Interview prep is $1.2B+ market, clear pain points |
| **Value Proposition** | ✅ STRONG | Systematic approach, community data, zero recurring cost |
| **Technical Feasibility** | ✅ PROVEN | 68% complete, no technical blockers |
| **Competitive Moat** | ⚠️ WEAK (SHORT-TERM) | Prompt quality + integration buys 12 months to build community moat |
| **Go-to-Market** | ✅ CLEAR | Product-led growth, organic channels, low CAC |
| **Team Capability** | ⚠️ TBD | Need 1 FTE dev (2-3 weeks), 0.5 FTE PM, 0.25 FTE design |

---

### The Honest Assessment

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Real user pain (interview prep is stressful, time-consuming, expensive)
- ✅ Innovative approach (augment existing subscription, not replace)
- ✅ Low technical risk (68% built, clear path to completion)
- ✅ Compelling value prop (one-time payment, lifetime value)
- ✅ Scalable architecture (zero marginal cost per user)

**Weaknesses:**
- ⚠️ Weak moat (easily replicable in 6-12 months)
- ⚠️ Commoditization risk (AI gets better, prompts matter less)
- ⚠️ Unproven community flywheel (network effects are hypothesis, not reality)
- ⚠️ Platform dependency (Claude-specific, Anthropic could change things)
- ⚠️ Quality control challenges (community contributions may be noisy)

**The Bet We're Making:**
- We can reach critical mass (10,000+ vault contributions) in 6-12 months
- Community data becomes defensible moat before prompt quality erodes
- Users value systematic workflows more than isolated AI advice
- One-time pricing overcomes "subscription fatigue"

---

### Recommendation: APPROVE - Mission-Driven Fast Launch

**Approve Because:**
1. **Mission alignment:** Break-even = success, helping users reach final rounds
2. **Fast MVP path:** 2 weeks to launch (28 hours, 3 skills already done)
3. **Clear North Star:** % reaching final rounds (not revenue)
4. **Reuse existing work:** interview-decoder, practice-analyzer, redflag-navigator already written
5. **Low risk, high mission value:** $49 accessible pricing, no infrastructure costs

**Conditions for Approval:**
1. **Focus on North Star metric:** Track % reaching final rounds obsessively
2. **No feature creep:** 5 skills only, no browser tools, no community vault for MVP
3. **Mission-first decisions:** If choosing between revenue and user outcomes, choose outcomes
4. **Kill criteria defined:** If <40% reach final rounds by Month 3, deep pivot

## SECTION 10: APPENDIX

### Success Criteria Summary (Mission-Driven)

**Week 2 (MVP Launch):**
- [ ] 5 core skills complete and functional
- [ ] Installation takes <5 minutes
- [ ] First 10 users successfully installed and using

**Month 1 (Early Validation):**
- [ ] 20-50 total users (organic, word-of-mouth)
- [ ] 50%+ reach final rounds (North Star validation)
- [ ] 60%+ use ≥3 skills (system value)
- [ ] NPS ≥ 50 from users who reached final rounds

**Month 3 (Mission Proof):**

### Kill Criteria (Mission Failure Signals)

If by **Month 3** we have not achieved:
- 40%+ users reaching final rounds (North Star failure)
- 50+ total users (no traction)
- Any positive user feedback (fundamental product failure)

Then:
- **Deep analysis:** Why aren't users reaching final rounds?
- **Skill audit:** Which skills work? Which don't?
- **Pivot or open-source:** Either fix the core issue or open-source and stop

**Rationale:** If we're not helping users reach final rounds, the mission has failed. Revenue doesn't matter if outcomes don't materialize. Better to admit failure fast than scale broken product.

### Team Requirements (Lean Mission-Driven)

**Phase 1 (MVP - Weeks 1-2):**
- 1 person with Claude + prompt engineering skills
- 28 hours of focused work
- No designer needed (markdown files only)
- No frontend engineer needed (no browser tools)

**Phase 2 (Validation - Months 1-3):**
- Same person, part-time
- Focus on user feedback and prompt iteration
- Track North Star metric
- No additional hires until mission proven

**Phase 3 (Scale - Only if Mission Proven):**
- Consider adding help only if:
  - 60%+ sustained final round rate
  - Break-even achieved
  - Demand exceeds capacity

### Budget Estimate (First 6 Months - Mission-Driven)

| Category | Cost | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| Development | $0 | Solo builder, 28 hours (sweat equity) |
| Design | $0 | No browser tools, markdown files only |
| Infrastructure | $0 | GitHub, email, Google Forms (all free) |
| Marketing | $0 | Organic only (word-of-mouth, Reddit, Twitter) |
| Legal | $0 | Use standard open templates, iterate if needed |
| Distribution | $50 | Gumroad/payment processing (3% fees) |
| **TOTAL** | **~$50** | Effectively zero upfront investment |

**Revenue Projection (Conservative, Mission-Driven):**
- Month 1: 20 users × $49 = $980
- Month 2: 30 users × $49 = $1,470
- Month 3: 50 users × $49 = $2,450

**Total Revenue (3 months):** $4,900
**Total Cost (3 months):** ~$250 (payment processing fees)
**Net:** $4,650

**Break-even:** Month 1 (effectively immediate since costs are near-zero)

**Philosophy:** This isn't about maximizing revenue. $49 pricing means break-even happens fast with tiny user base. Focus is entirely on North Star: helping users reach final rounds.
