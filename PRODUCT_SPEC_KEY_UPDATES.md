# PRODUCT SPEC - KEY UPDATES SUMMARY
## Mission-Driven Strategy Implementation

**Date:** 2025-11-04
**Updated By:** Product Management Team
**Changes:** Mission-driven strategy, simplified MVP, 2-week timeline

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY CHANGES

### NEW: Mission-Driven Philosophy
```markdown
**Mission-Driven Philosophy:**
This is NOT a profit-maximization venture. Success = break-even while helping
candidates reach final rounds. We're building a community service that pays for
itself, not extracting maximum revenue from desperate job seekers.

**North Star Metric:** % of Users Reaching Final Rounds
- NOT revenue, NOT downloads, NOT engagement vanity metrics
- We succeed when users get to final interview stages
- Everything optimizes for this outcome
```

### CHANGED: Product Scope
- **BEFORE:** 7 Claude skill files
- **AFTER:** 5 Claude skill files (focused MVP)

### CHANGED: Pricing
- **BEFORE:** $49-99 pricing, multiple tiers, optional services
- **AFTER:** $49 flat pricing, no tiers, no upsells, accessible mission-driven pricing

---

## COMPETITIVE MOAT CHANGES

### NEW: Philosophy as Moat (Not Defensive Barriers)

**BEFORE Approach:** Worried about 2-4 week replication
**AFTER Approach:** "We don't care what competitors can do in 2-4 weeks if we're genuinely serving the community."

### NEW: 4-Layer Moat from moatleadpm.md

**Layer 1: 4-Layer Strategic Depth**
- Not just tactical prep (STAR, common questions)
- Operational depth (psychology, power dynamics)
- Strategic positioning (internal champions, leverage creation)
- Meta-strategic thinking (when to walk away, career-long skills)

**Layer 2: Compound Intelligence System**
- 5 skills working as orchestrated system
- Intelligence multiplies through data flow
- Personal network effects (gets smarter with use)

**Layer 3: Expertise Encoding**
- 20+ years recruiting/hiring wisdom embedded
- Recruiter psychology, hiring manager dynamics, executive perspectives
- Can't be Googled or scraped

**Layer 4: Philosophy-Driven Approach (Mission Moat)**
- Building career strategists, not interview performers
- Mission-driven = optimize for outcomes, not revenue
- $49 accessible pricing signals values
- Trust through mission alignment

## SUCCESS METRICS CHANGES

### NEW: North Star Metric

**BEFORE:** Offers Accepted at 15%+ Higher Compensation
**AFTER:** % of Users Reaching Final Rounds

**Why the change:**
- Mission is helping users reach final rounds, not maximizing their comp
- Revenue is NOT the goal (break-even is success)
- Forces optimization for actual interview success
- Aligns with mission-driven philosophy

### NEW: Success Criteria (Mission-Driven)

| Timeframe | Old Target | New Target | Philosophy Shift |
|-----------|-----------|------------|------------------|
| **Month 1** | 50 paying users, 70% activation | 20-50 users, 50%+ reach finals | Quality over quantity |
| **Month 3** | 500 users, vault contributions | 100 users, 60%+ reach finals, break-even | Outcomes over growth |
| **Month 6** | 2,000 users, community flywheel | Sustained 60% final round rate | Mission over moat |
| **Month 12** | 10,000 users, profitable | Break-even, helping hundreds | Sustainable over profitable |

---

## ROADMAP CHANGES

### NEW: 2-Week MVP Timeline (Not 3-4 Weeks)

**Phase 1: MVP (Weeks 1-2) - "Launch Fast, Validate Mission"**

**What's Already Done:**

- ✅ practice-analyzer.md
- ✅ redflag-navigator.md

**What Needs Building:**
- ⏳ story-builder.md: 8 hours
- ⏳ company-intel.md: 12 hours
- ⏳ claude.md orchestration: 4 hours
- ⏳ Installation guide: 4 hours
- **Total: 28 hours**

**Success Criteria:**

- Gamification, moderation systems
- Network effects as primary moat

**AFTER Strategy:**

## BUDGET CHANGES

### Lean Mission-Driven Economics

| Category | Old Budget | New Budget | Change |
|----------|-----------|------------|--------|
| Development | $30,000 | $0 (sweat equity) | -100% |
| Design | $5,000 | $0 (no browser tools) | -100% |
| Infrastructure | $0 | $0 | Same |
| Marketing | $5,000 | $0 (organic only) | -100% |
| Legal | $2,000 | $0 (templates) | -100% |
| **TOTAL** | **$42,000** | **~$50** | **-99.9%** |

**Break-even:**
- **Old:** Month 3, need 420 users @ $99
- **New:** Month 1, need ~10 users @ $49

**Philosophy:** Not about maximizing revenue. Break-even happens fast with tiny user base. Focus entirely on helping users reach final rounds.

---

## MOAT STRATEGY CHANGES

### From Defensive to Value-Driven

**BEFORE: "Buy Time to Build Community"**
- Phase 1: Prompt excellence (establish perception)
- Phase 2: System integration (build switching costs)
- Phase 3: Community flywheel (create data moat)
- Racing against 12-month competitor catch-up timeline

**AFTER: "Deep Value First, Community Later"**
- Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2): MVP launch, prove individual value
- Phase 2 (Months 1-3): Iterate on outcomes, track North Star
- Phase 3 (Months 3-6+): Community only if/when needed
- Not racing competitors, focused on user outcomes

---

## KILL CRITERIA CHANGES

### Faster Failure Recognition

**BEFORE:**
- If by Month 6: <1,000 users AND <1,000 vault contributions AND NPS <40
- Focus on community traction as success metric
- 6-month timeline to prove moat

**AFTER:**
- If by Month 3: <40% reach final rounds OR <50 users OR no positive feedback
- Focus on North Star metric (mission success)
- 3-month timeline to prove concept
- **Rationale:** "If we're not helping users reach final rounds, the mission has failed. Revenue doesn't matter if outcomes don't materialize."

---

## TEAM CHANGES

### Solo Mission-Driven Launch

**BEFORE:**
- Phase 1: 1 FTE Engineer + 0.5 FTE PM + 0.25 FTE Designer
- Phase 2: Add community manager + marketing
- Phase 3: Add backend engineer + customer success

**AFTER:**
- Phase 1: 1 person, 28 hours, no hires
- Phase 2: Same person part-time, track North Star
- Phase 3: Only hire if 60%+ final round rate + break-even + demand exceeds capacity
