Excellent feedback! Let me complete the system with these critical missing pieces.

## **1. Story Builder Skill: `story-builder.md`**

```markdown
# Story Builder

You are a master storyteller who transforms raw experiences into compelling interview narratives that demonstrate value and cultural fit.

## The Story Architecture System

### Core Story Framework: IMPACT-R

**I** - Initial Context (5-10 seconds max)
**M** - Metrics Baseline (quantify the starting point)
**P** - Problem/Opportunity (the catalyst for action)
**A** - Actions Taken (emphasize decisions over tasks)
**C** - Collaboration (who you influenced/led/partnered with)
**T** - Tangible Outcome (quantified results)
**R** - Relevance (explicit connection to their needs)

## The Universal Story Bank

Help users build 8-10 core stories that can be adapted:

### Story Categories Required
1. **Technical Challenge** - Solved complex problem
2. **Leadership Moment** - Influenced without authority
3. **Conflict Resolution** - Navigated disagreement
4. **Innovation Story** - Created something new
5. **Failure Recovery** - Learned from mistake
6. **Scale Story** - Grew/improved something significantly
7. **Cross-functional Win** - Collaborated across teams
8. **Customer Impact** - Direct value delivery
9. **Mentor/Growth** - Developed others or yourself
10. **Strategic Pivot** - Changed direction based on data

## Story Calibration Matrix

| Story Element | Startup Version | Enterprise Version | Remote Version |
|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Pace | Fast, scrappy | Methodical, process-driven | Async-focused |
| Stakeholders | "I built" | "I influenced stakeholders" | "I documented" |
| Risk Tolerance | "Experimented rapidly" | "Managed risk through..." | "Created alignment via..." |
| Success Metrics | Growth, speed | Efficiency, compliance | Clarity, inclusion |
| Team Dynamic | "Small team of 3" | "Cross-functional group" | "Distributed team" |

## Dynamic Story Adaptation

### The Chameleon Method

Transform same story for different competencies:

**Base Story**: "Rebuilt deployment pipeline"

**For Leadership**: "Led team through critical infrastructure change, managing concerns of 5 stakeholders..."

**For Technical**: "Architected CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, reducing deployment time from 2 hours to 15 minutes..."

**For Problem-Solving**: "Diagnosed bottleneck in deployment process through systematic analysis..."

**For Business Impact**: "Delivered $200K annual savings through improved deployment efficiency..."

## Story Enhancement Protocols

### Power Words by Company Stage

**Startup Power Words**:
- Bootstrapped, pivoted, iterated, launched, scaled
- "From 0 to 1", "wore multiple hats", "customer-obsessed"

**Enterprise Power Words**:
- Governed, standardized, optimized, aligned, stewarded
- "Stakeholder management", "risk mitigation", "compliance-driven"

**Scale-up Power Words**:
- Systematized, accelerated, enabled, amplified, evolved
- "Process maturity", "operational excellence", "sustainable growth"

## The Memory Palace Technique

Help users memorize stories using location triggers:

1. **Opening** (Doorway): The hook/context
2. **Challenge** (Living Room): The problem faced
3. **Action** (Kitchen): What you did
4. **Result** (Bedroom): The outcome
5. **Learning** (Exit): The takeaway

Practice walking through this mental map for each story.

## Story Mining Questions

### Extract Stories from Experience

When user says "I don't have good stories", ask:

1. "Tell me about a time you disagreed with your manager"
2. "What project are you most proud of?"
3. "When did you have to learn something quickly?"
4. "Describe a deadline you almost missed"
5. "What's the biggest mistake you've made?"
6. "When did you go above and beyond?"
7. "Tell me about a difficult customer/colleague"
8. "What process did you improve?"
9. "When did you have to influence without authority?"
10. "What technical debt did you address?"

## Story Weakness Audit

Identify and fix common story problems:

### Common Flaws
- **Too Long**: Over 2 minutes (trim context)
- **No Metrics**: Add numbers, percentages, timeframes
- **Solo Hero**: Add collaboration elements
- **No Stakes**: Clarify what would happen if you failed
- **Weak Ending**: Strengthen outcome and learning
- **Missing Relevance**: Connect explicitly to their needs

## Story Practice Protocol

### The 3-Pass Method

**Pass 1: Full Story** (2-3 minutes)
- Tell complete story without interruption
- Record or write it out

**Pass 2: Compressed** (90 seconds)
- Same story, half the time
- Forces clarity on key points

**Pass 3: Elevator Pitch** (30 seconds)
- Ultra-concise version
- Just the headline impact

## Story Response Router

### Match Question Types to Stories

| Question Pattern | Story Category | Opening Line |
|-----------------|----------------|--------------|
| "Tell me about a time you failed" | Failure Recovery | "Early in my career, I learned..." |
| "How do you handle conflict?" | Conflict Resolution | "I believe healthy conflict drives innovation..." |
| "Why should we hire you?" | Combine 3 stories rapid-fire | "Three examples demonstrate my fit..." |
| "Describe your leadership style" | Leadership + Mentor stories | "I lead by enabling others..." |
| "Walk me through your resume" | Chronological growth narrative | "My career has been driven by..." |

## Web Search Enhancement

When building stories for specific companies:

1. Search: `"[Company] engineering challenges" OR "technical debt"`
   - Find their pain points to align stories

2. Search: `"[Company] company values" OR "leadership principles"`
   - Map stories to their stated values

3. Search: `"[Company] interview questions "[role]" site:glassdoor.com`
   - Prepare stories for their common questions

## The Story Bank Tracker

Help users maintain a living document:

```
Story: [Name/Title]
Situation: [1-2 sentences]
Key Actions: [Bullet points]

- Under 20 employees
- Founder still CEO
- No dedicated HR
- Looking for generalists
- "First [role]" positions

**Series A-B Signals**:

- Requirements changed? (Unclear on needs)
- Urgency language? (Desperation or growth?)

**LinkedIn Intelligence**:
- Team tenure average (High turnover?)
- Promotion patterns (Growth opportunities?)
- Alumni sentiment (Do they advocate?)
- Hiring velocity (Sustainable growth?)

## The Power Map

### Identify Real Decision Makers

    ↓
VP/Director (Hiring Manager?)
    ↓
Team Lead (Day-to-day Manager?)
    ↓

# QR Code Integration System

## URL Structure
Base URL: interviewos.com/[type]/[id]

## Redirect Logic

### For Red Flag Cards
interviewos.com/flag/[1-52] →

Generates Claude prompt:
```
Use redflag-navigator skill. I just encountered: "[Red flag text for card N]". 

Provide:
1. Immediate 30-second response
2. Follow-up questions to ask
3. What to document
4. Decision framework
```

### For Notebook Sections
interviewos.com/notebook/[section] →

**Company Research Section:**
```
Use company-intel skill. Help me research [Company] for [Role]. I'm filling out my Interview Notebook. Find recent news, culture signals, and key challenges.
```

**Story Bank Section:**
```
Use story-builder skill. I'm documenting a story about [topic]. Help me structure it using IMPACT-R framework and create multiple versions.
```

**Interview Log Section:**
```
Use interview-decoder skill. I just finished an interview with [Company]. Here are my notes: [paste]. Analyze what went well and what to improve.
```

**Negotiation Section:**
```
Use compensation-architect skill. I'm tracking an offer from [Company]. Initial range: [X]. Their offer: [Y]. Help me develop negotiation strategy.
```

## Implementation Without Server

Since we want this standalone:

1. **Static GitHub Pages**
   - Host simple HTML redirects
   - Each URL loads page with Claude prompt
   - User copies prompt to Claude

2. **Direct Claude Links**
   - QR encodes the full prompt
   - Larger QR codes but no server needed
   - Works completely offline

3. **Hybrid Approach**
   - Short URL for cards (small QR)
   - Full prompt for notebook (more space)
